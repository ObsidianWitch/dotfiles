## cdc - Change directory to current one.
## When locking my screen, I unmount ~/Private/plaintext. It allows me to not
## have sensitive data be mounted when my screen is locked. Though, when I
## unlock my session problems appear in already opened shells.
## For example, a shell opened in a git directory before locking is not
## recognized as a git repository anymore.
## To fix the situation, I must change the directory to the current location,
## which is what this alias does.
