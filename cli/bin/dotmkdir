# dotmkdir - make directories
#
# Synopsis
#   dotmkdir dest[/]...
#
# Description
#   Create all directory components of a path as needed, no error if existing.
#   If `dest` doesn't have a trailing slash, the last component will be treated
#   as a file. If `dest` has a trailing slash, the last component will be
#   treated as a directory.
#
# Examples
#   mkdir path/to/file
#   --> created directories `path/` and `path/to/`
#
#   mkdir path/to/dir/
#   --> created directories `path/`, `path/to/` and `path/to/dir/`
